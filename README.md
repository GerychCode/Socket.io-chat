# Running the Project
After installing the dependencies for both parts of the project, you can run them.

# Running the Server-side
1.In the "chat-server" directory, run the command node . to start the server-side of the project.
2.The server will be running on the port specified in the configuration file, by default on port 3001.

# Running the Client-side
1.In the "chat-ui" directory, run the command npm start to start the client-side of the project.
